 # Tabibito

A travel log app where you can share your adventures with everyone.

## Description

This is my first fullstack MERN app. I focused more at the backend in this project since this is also the first project where
I built the backend by myself. Truly a great experience, I learned a lot building this project.

### Tech stack:

* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Socket io

#### Other things I learned:

* MVC pattern
* REST API
* Server authentication
* Hashing
* JWT
* Websockets
* Managing Nosql Database
* Email Verification

##### Bugs to fix:
*Instead of storing images in the backend server, upload the images to a cloud storage then get the link/path for that image then store that to the db.(pref. aws s3)

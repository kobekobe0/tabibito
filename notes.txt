when updating budget object, in the FE copy the recent values then send that value with the updated one

e.g. BE sends 1000,2000,3000,4000 (food, transpo, acomo, other)  -   then user updates the food value
in req.body = 
{
  "food": newValue,
  "transpo": copyOldVal,
  "acomo": copyOldVal,
  "other": copyOldVal,
}


for every request, send the user JWT token as headers
